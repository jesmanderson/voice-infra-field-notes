# General Project Flow Template 

## Purpose 
This document provides a clear, repeatable framework for managing technical projects from start to finish.  
It’s designed to help engineers, project leads, and IT teams plan, execute, and close out projects efficiently; whether you're migrating to Microsoft 365, deploying infrastructure, or rolling out new tools.  
Use this as a baseline template and customize it to fit your specific project needs.


## The Standard Project Flow
| Stage |	What Happens |
| :-------  | :------ |
| 1. Initiation | Define the problem, the goal, and the success criteria. |
| 2. Planning | Design the solution, create a plan, gather resources. |
| 3. Execution (Implementation) | Build/deploy the solution based on the plan. |
| 4. Monitoring and Control  | Track progress, fix issues, adjust if needed during buildout. |
| 5. Closure  | Validate success, document outcomes, and handoff or maintain if necessary. |  

## 1. Initiation — "Why are we doing this?"
- Identify the business need or technical problem.
- Write a simple **Problem Statement** and **Goal Statement**.
- Figure out the **Success Criteria** (how will we know it's done right?). 
> Example for M365 Migration:  
> - Problem: Two tenants cause confusion and double licensing.  
> - Goal: Consolidate into one optimized tenant.  
> - Success: All users migrated, minimal downtime, no data loss, improved security.

## 2. Planning — "How exactly are we going to do this?" 
- Map out the **high-level steps** (roadmap).
- Identify **risks** and **dependencies**.
- Assign or document **tools needed** (Migration tools, scripts, access).
- **Create a Timeline**: What happens when?
- **Backup and rollback plans**: What if something fails? 
> Example for M365 Migration Planning:
> 
> - Pre-migration audit
> - Domain preparation
> - Mailbox migration
> - SharePoint/OneDrive migration
> - Teams migration
> - User re-training and communication
> - Post-migration validation 

## 3. Execution — "Let’s do it." 
- Start doing the actual work: migration, deployments, building servers, etc.
- Follow the plan, step-by-step.
- Communicate status updates if it's a team effort.
> Example: Actually moving mailboxes, setting up DNS records, testing user access. 

## 4. Monitoring and Control — "Is it working right?"
- Constantly check during the work:
    - Are users getting emails?
    - Is SharePoint content moving correctly?
    - Are permissions correct?
- Fix problems immediately.
- Adjust your plan if you need to (small pivots).
> Example:  
> Halfway through, you find out permissions aren’t migrating right.
> You pause, fix it, adjust your migration tool settings, and resume

## 5. Closure — "Is everything complete and documented?"
- Validate everything works according to the Success Criteria.
- Document:
    - What you did.
    - What problems you faced (and fixed).
    - Final setup or configs (good for disaster recovery later).
- Conduct a **lessons learned** (even if it's just for yourself). 
> Example:
> 
> - All mailboxes, files, Teams chats migrated successfully.
> - Users trained on new sign-in process.
> - Security policies enforced.
> - Documented steps in case recovery is needed in the future.
