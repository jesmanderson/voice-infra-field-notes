# Weekly Change Advisory Board (CAB) Meetings

Welcome to the CAB Meeting Summary! This document is designed to help new engineers understand the purpose, structure, and value of weekly CAB meetings in a Cisco or enterprise environment.

## Purpose of CAB Meetings

Change Advisory Board (CAB) meetings are held to review, approve, and coordinate changes to the production environment. These meetings ensure that changes are:
- Properly documented
- Assessed for risk and impact
- Scheduled with minimal disruption
- Communicated across teams

CAB is a cornerstone of ITIL-based change management and helps maintain system stability while enabling innovation.

## What We Discuss

Each CAB meeting typically covers:
- **Upcoming Changes**: Review of scheduled changes for the week
- **Change Details**: Scope, impact, rollback plan, and testing status
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluation of potential risks and mitigation strategies
- **Approvals**: Final go/no-go decisions from stakeholders
- **Post-Change Reviews**: Lessons learned from recent changes

## How Engineers Should Prepare

To contribute effectively to CAB meetings:
- Submit your change request (CR) in advance with complete details
- Be ready to explain the change, its purpose, and expected impact
- Prepare rollback and validation plans
- Coordinate with affected teams and document dependencies
- Be available to answer questions during the meeting

## Lessons Learned & Action Items

From recent CAB meetings, we've learned:
- Always validate DTMF and codec compatibility before IVR changes
- SCCP media resources must be registered and assigned via MRGLs
- Documenting rollback steps clearly helps reduce downtime
- Cross-team communication is key for successful change execution

**Action Items:**
- Review MRGL assignments for all IVR-related devices
- Update change templates to include media resource verification
- Schedule post-change validation calls with stakeholders

## Final Thoughts

CAB meetings are not just about approvals, theyâ€™re about collaboration, learning, and building trust across teams. As an engineer, your voice matters. Ask questions, share insights, and help us make every change a success.
