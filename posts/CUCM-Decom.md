# CUCM Legacy Cluster Decommissioning & Migration 

## Overview 
This guide walks through the strategic decommissioning of legacy Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) clusters across multiple regions and the migration of users to modern communication platforms. It’s designed to help entry-level UC engineers understand the lifecycle of a decom project—from planning to execution and closure.

## Why Decommission Legacy CUCM?
Legacy CUCM clusters often present challenges such as:
- High maintenance costs and outdated hardware
- Limited integration with modern collaboration platforms
- Fragmented management and poor disaster recovery (DR) capabilities <br/>

By migrating to Microsoft Teams Voice or a centralized CUCM cluster, organizations can streamline operations, improve user experience, and enhance resilience.

## Project Goals
- Simplify voice infrastructure
- Reduce operational overhead
- Enable modern collaboration tools
- Ensure business continuity and DR readiness

## Who Benefits?
- IT Operations Teams: Easier management and monitoring
- End Users: Improved call quality and collaboration features
- DR & Compliance Teams: Centralized backup and failover capabilities

## Key Features of the Project
- Full inventory and dependency mapping of legacy CUCM clusters
- Phased migration to Microsoft Teams Voice and centralized CUCM
- Automated backup and DR validation for the new environment
- Structured decommissioning workflow integrated with change management

## Setup Instructions
1. Document legacy CUCM cluster configurations and dependencies.
2. Create backup of all CUCM clusters.
3. Design target architecture for centralized CUCM and Teams Voice.
4. Configure Teams Voice and central CUCM for incoming users.
5. Validate DR and backup automation.
6. Begin phased migration and decom.

## Project Execution Flow
### Initiation
- Problem: Legacy CUCM clusters were fragmented and hard to manage.
- Goal: Migrate users to centralized, modern platforms.
- Success Criteria: 100% user migration, zero downtime, full DR coverage.

### Planning
- Scope: All regional CUCM clusters.
- Timeline: 6 months
- Risks: User disruption, configuration mismatches, DR gaps

### Execution
- Inventory and backup of legacy clusters
- Migration of users to Teams Voice and central CUCM
- DR and backup automation setup
- Change requests submitted for each decom phase

### Monitoring/Control
- Continuous monitoring via SolarWinds
- Validation of backups and DR failover
- User feedback and issue tracking

### Closure
- Network ports disabled
- CUCM servers powered down
- Documentation finalized
- Lessons learned captured

## Outcomes
### Achievements:
- Successfully decommissioned regional CUCM clusters
- Migrated analog users to central CUCM
- Created DR and automated backup for central CUCM
- Submitted change requests for all decommissioning phases

### Metrics:
- 99.9% migration success
- 0 downtime during migration
- Full DR coverage validated

## Future Enhancements
- Expand Teams Voice to remaining analog endpoints
- Containerize CUCM monitoring tools
- Integrate AI-based alerting for voice infrastructure
