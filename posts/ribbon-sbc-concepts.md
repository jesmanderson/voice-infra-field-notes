# 🔒 SBC (Ribbon) Concepts — Field Notes

As a UC engineer working in a hybrid world of CUCM, Teams, and global carrier interconnects, understanding Session Border Controllers (SBCs) is mission-critical. Here’s a breakdown of what an SBC is, why it’s used, and how I work with CRTs, TTs, and call flow configurations specifically on the Ribbon SBC 2000.

## 🧱 What Is an SBC?

A **Session Border Controller (SBC)** is a device or virtual appliance that:
- Sits at the edge of your VoIP network
- Controls SIP signaling and RTP media
- Secures, routes, and normalizes VoIP traffic
- Interconnects internal voice systems (e.g., CUCM, Teams) with external systems (e.g., carriers)

### 🧠 Key Functions:
- Protocol normalization (SIP to SIP variants)
- Topology hiding
- Codec translation
- Encryption (TLS/SRTP)
- Call routing + number transformation
- Session admission control + bandwidth policies

Ribbon SBCs, especially the SBC 2000, are widely used for Microsoft Teams Direct Routing and CUCM interop.

## 📞 Call Flow Configuration on Ribbon

The basic building blocks of a call flow inside a Ribbon SBC include:

### 🔁 Call Routing Table (CRT)
- **Think of this like a routing map**
- CRTs determine **where to send the call** based on criteria (like called number, source IP, or signaling group)
- You can have multiple CRTs, inbound vs. outbound
- Each CRT entry includes:
  - Matching rule (pattern, SIP headers)
  - Target signaling group
  - Optional priority, filtering

### 🔀 Transformation Table (TT)
- TT handles **digit manipulation**,  number rewriting
- Works similarly to CUCM translation patterns or route filters
- Can apply to:
  - Called number (CDPN)
  - Calling number (CGPN)
  - SIP headers (From, P-Asserted-Identity, etc.)
- TTs are assigned in the Signaling Group configuration or directly in the CRT

## 🧪 Example Call Flow

1. **Inbound PSTN Call** from carrier
2. **SBC receives INVITE** on external signaling group
3. **TT normalizes called number** (e.g., strips +, formats to E.164)
4. **CRT checks match** and routes call to internal signaling group (e.g., CUCM or Teams)
5. **Call delivered internally** with rewritten number and required headers

## 🔍 Real-World Notes
- I’ve used TTs to rewrite Brazilian carrier numbers to match CUCM route patterns
- CRTs are critical when multiple carriers share a SIP trunk, routing logic by source IP is common
- When calls fail silently, I always check:
  - If the CRT is matching
  - If the TT is rewriting as expected
  - If the signaling group is up and registered

## ✅ Summary
SBCs aren’t just hardware, they’re the voice firewall, router, and security gatekeeper for your entire VoIP ecosystem. Learning how CRTs and TTs work helps you master call routing logic, especially in global or multi-system deployments like CUCM + Teams + carriers.
